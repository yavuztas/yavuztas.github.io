### Overview
This is the **third** post of the series [Spring Framework Fundamentals](https://github.com/yavuztas/java-spring-fundamentals){:target="blank"}.

When we deal with the **real business requirements** in application development, **IoC containers** can come in very handy. They provide us a frictionless orchestration of components, beans, classes, etc. out of the box.

However, most of the time developers need more than that. Separating property sources and configuration files, application-wide event publishing mechanisms, loosely coupled pre/post processors and many more can be a grind of our daily work unless we choose a modern application framework to properly delegate this heavy lifting.

Hopefully, today's IoC containers in most of the modern frameworks **bring us the remedy for many enterprise-level requirements**.

In this article, we are going to explain *ApplicationContext* in **Spring Framework**.

### What is meant by *ApplicationContext*?
*ApplicationContext* is a central Spring container that provides many ready to use business features for enterprise-level applications.

The basic service of *ApplicationContext* is exposing another container **BeanFactory**, which are managing the lifecycle of a **Spring Bean** such as creating, wiring, assembling and accessing them up to their destruction.

*ApplicationContext* is a higher-level container than *BeanFactory*, already contains its features by implementing the various *BeanFactory* interfaces.

Beyond these bean-related abilities, *ApplicationContext* provides more features like;
 * Providing application level configurations
 * Reading textual messages from convenient *MessageSource* properties
 * Publishing application events
 * Providing automatic pre/post processor registrations like *BeanPostProcessor* and *BeanFactoryPostProcessor*.

On some occasions, like mobile environments where you have limited memory resources and performance requirements, you may consider using *BeanFactory* instead of *ApplicationContext*. However, the latter is more appropriate and we prefer for server-based applications in most cases.

You can check the description over on [spring java doc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationContext.html) for more details.

### Creating an *ApplicationContext*
Spring Framework has many special *ApplicationContext* implementations for different needs but creating a new *ApplicationContext* is as simple as initializing just a simple java class.

Let's give an example of creating a *FileSystemXmlApplicationContext* instance:
{% highlight java %}

FileSystemXmlApplicationContext appContext = new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext(
  "src/main/resources/beans.xml");

SampleBean sampleBean = appContext.getBean("sampleBean", SampleBean.class);
sampleBean.saySomething("Hello World!");

{% endhighlight %}
Also, there are different *ApplicationContext* implementations like:
{% highlight java %}

ClassPathXmlApplicationContext appContext = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
  "beans.xml");

SampleBean sampleBean = appContext.getBean("sampleBean", SampleBean.class);
sampleBean.saySomething("Hello World!");

{% endhighlight %}
And this is the XML file for our configuration:
{% highlight xml %}
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="sampleBean" class="dev.yavuztas.spring.context.SampleBean">
        <property name="message" value="Initial value" />
    </bean>

</beans>
{% endhighlight %}

### Lifecycle of a Spring Bean in an *ApplicationContext*
Spring beans are managed and orchestrated by the IoC container *BeanFactory* which is already available in *ApplicationContext*. There are many stages for a spring bean from creation to destruction when we go through deep.

However, we keep it simple by grouping into **5 sections**.

These sections are;
 * *Aware* interfaces for injecting infrastructure components
 * *@PostConstruct* and *@PreDestroy* annotations
 * *InitializingBean* and *DisposableBean* for callback execution
 * *init-method* and *destroy-method* configurations
 * *BeanPostProcessor* for altering beans before or after initialization

After constructor execution and setting properties, **first of all** *Aware* interfaces come into play like *BeanNameAware*, *BeanFactoryAware*.

Let's give an example of how to use these *Aware* interfaces:
{% highlight java %}
public class SampleBean implements BeanNameAware, BeanFactoryAware {

    private String message;

    @Override
    public void setBeanName(String name) {

        System.out.println("--- setBeanName executed ---");

    }

    @Override
    public void setBeanFactory(BeanFactory beanFactory) throws BeansException {

        System.out.println("--- setBeanFactory executed ---");

    }

    // getters and setters

}
{% endhighlight %}
When we initialize the spring context we will see that *setBeanName* method executed before the *setBeanFactory* method. This indicates that there is also an execution order between *Aware* interfaces. For more details and a full list of them, you may check over on [spring docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/Aware.html)

For the **second** step, the bean methods which are marked by *@PostConstruct* annotation are executed.

Let's define another method for our bean configured as *@PostConstruct*:
{% highlight java %}

@PostConstruct
public void postConstruct() {

    System.out.println("--- @PostConstruct executed ---");

}

{% endhighlight %}
To make *@PostConstruct* and *@PreDestroy* annotations work, we need to define *CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor* as registered in our spring configuration.
{% highlight xml %}
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean
      class="org.springframework.context.annotation.CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor" />

    <bean id="sampleBean" class="dev.yavuztas.spring.context.SampleBean">
        <property name="message" value="Initial value" />
    </bean>

</beans>
{% endhighlight %}
Another way to make it out is configuring *&lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;* either in XML or Java configuration.

As for the **third** step, *InitializingBean* interface comes in with its single *afterPropertiesSet* callback function.

Let's make our bean to implement *InitializingBean*:
{% highlight java %}
public class SampleBean implements BeanNameAware, BeanFactoryAware, InitializingBean {

    // rest of the class omitted

    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {

        System.out.println("--- afterPropertiesSet executed ---");

    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

As the step **four**, *init-method* configuration shows up. We can define any method and mark it in our bean configuration.

Let's create another method for our bean:
{% highlight java %}

public void initMethod() {

    System.out.println("--- init-method executed ---");

}

{% endhighlight %}
And mark it as *init-method*:
{% highlight xml %}

<bean id="sampleBean" init-method="initMethod"
  class="dev.yavuztas.spring.context.SampleBean">
    <property name="message" value="Initial value" />
</bean>

{% endhighlight %}
As for the **last** step, we can define a *BeanPostProcessor* to run a custom operation before a spring bean initializes or after. We should pay attention that *BeanPostProcessor* classes are executed for every bean defined in our spring context.

Let's create a *BeanPostProcessor*:
{% highlight java %}
public class CustomBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor {

    @Override
    public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName)
      throws BeansException {

        System.out.println("--- postProcessBeforeInitialization executed ---");

        return BeanPostProcessor.super.postProcessBeforeInitialization(bean, beanName);
    }

    @Override
    public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName)
      throws BeansException {

        System.out.println("--- postProcessAfterInitialization executed ---");

        return BeanPostProcessor.super.postProcessAfterInitialization(bean, beanName);
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}
Of course, we need to register our new post-processor as a spring bean to make it work:
{% highlight xml %}

<bean class="dev.yavuztas.spring.context.CustomBeanPostProcessor" />

{% endhighlight %}
When we boot our spring context, we will see that our *CustomBeanPostProcessor*'s *postProcessBeforeInitialization* method is executed right before the *@PostConstruct* and the other method *postProcessAfterInitialization* is executed after *init-method*.

For the **destruction** stage of spring beans, we can also configure *@PreDestroy*, *DisposableBean* and *destroy-method*.  

Let's define these methods for our bean:
{% highlight java %}
public class SampleBean implements
  BeanNameAware, BeanFactoryAware, InitializingBean, DisposableBean {

    // rest of the class omitted

    @PreDestroy
    public void preDestroy() {

        System.out.println("--- @PreDestroy executed ---");

    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() throws Exception {

        System.out.println("--- destroy executed ---");

    }

    public void destroyMethod() {

        System.out.println("--- destroy-method executed ---");

    }

}
{% endhighlight %}
And do not forget to configure *destroy-method* in our bean config:
{% highlight xml %}

<bean id="sampleBean" init-method="initMethod" destroy-method="destroyMethod"
  class="dev.yavuztas.spring.context.SampleBean">
    <property name="message" value="Initial value" />
</bean>

{% endhighlight %}

**Finally**, if we close our running spring-context, we will see our destruction methods are executed in the order as;
 * *@PreDestroy*
 * *DisposableBean*
 * *destroy-method*

### Closing an *ApplicationContext*
We can close Spring's *ApplicationContext* by simply calling the method *close* of the context:
{% highlight java %}

appContext.close();

{% endhighlight %}
Besides, we do not have to manually close, instead, we can easily configure *ApplicationContext* to automatically close itself on JVM shutdown:
{% highlight java %}

appContext.registerShutdownHook();

{% endhighlight %}
Furthermore, if we are using **Spring Boot**, we do not need to do anything to close our application context because it is automatically configured to be closed in the shutdown stage.

### Conclusion
In this article of our series, **we learned what the ApplicationContext is and how it works in Spring Framework.**

As always, you can check the related code examples [over on Github](https://github.com/yavuztas/java-spring-fundamentals/tree/master/src/main/java/dev/yavuztas/spring/context){:target="blank"}.

After we talked about *ApplicationContext*, in our next post, we will go on with the *component scanning and auto-injection* of spring beans.

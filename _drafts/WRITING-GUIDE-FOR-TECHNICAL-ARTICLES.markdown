### Some advices about good writing:

* *About "the" usage:* When using "Jackson" as a noun, instead of "the Jackson", just say "Jackson". We can keep "the" when "Jackson" is used as an adjective,
e.g. "the Jackson library".

* No need to repeat the output snippet if it's the same.

* For the intro section, it's often good to use the *why/how/what* formula.
    - Serializing our data structure....
    - So, this is where....
    - In this short tutorial, ....

* Try to make sure that if you're explaining the context of something, you give an example of what someone might try to do, how the defaults don't meet the need, and therefore what the motivation is for using our method.

* Similarly, when you're explaining things, try to get to a working example as quickly as possible and then explain the detail.

### Sample conclusion;
<h2 id="conclusion">4. Conclusion</h2>
In this tutorial, <strong>we learned what the Hexagonal Architecture is and how to implement a quick and practical example of it in Java</strong>.

Like always, all the code samples shown in this tutorial are available <a href="https://github.com">over on GitHub</a>.

### Samples (not used yet)

Despite changing business requirements nowadays, desire for a stable and maintainable software have definitely led us more capable frameworks with an expected trade-off over complexity and steep learning curve. We can count many implementations of JPA specification in Java like Hibernate, jOOQ, etc. as an example.

## 1. Overview
Introduction to mention what a *MessageInterpolator* is and when we may want to use *ParameterMessageInterpolator*

## 2. Setting up Custom Message Interpolators
Explain 3 different ways of how we can set up a custom *MessageInterpolator* which will be *ParameterMessageInterpolator* in this case.

### 2.1. Defining in *validation.xml*

### 2.2. Configuring *ValidatorFactory*

### 2.3. Configuring *Validator*

## 3. Extending *ParameterMessageInterpolator*
Might be an example subclass of *ParameterMessageInterpolator* in order to show that we can easily add extra capabilities to customize in purpose.

## 4. Conclusion
In this tutorial, **we learned ...**.

Like always, the sample implementation for this tutorial are available [over on GitHub](https://github.com).

## Questions to editor?

There is an article about Java Bean Validation which is, I think, the predecessor and the cause of the creation of this issue. Here is the link: ...
And my question is, how should we suppose to introduce this article?

1. Starting all from the beginning like what bean validation or JSR-380 is and how to set up the maven dependencies to make it work.
2. Or, assuming all the environment is ready, just mention to that article and go on with details

I feel the second option is more appropriate but what do you think?

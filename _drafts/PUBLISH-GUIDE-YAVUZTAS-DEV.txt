* Series of Spring Fundamentals should be published only your blog

### If you publish only on your own blog

1. Filename should be in YYYY-MM-DD-full-title-of-article
2. Image files should be named as the same with title, but can be simplified. Ex: title-article.png
3. Prepare header images with full title, sometimes can be simplified if too long, with the appropriate one, java or spring
4. Do not forget mobile images for header



### If you target to import on outside like medium, dzone, etc.

1. Find a good quality, eye-catching image about developer, team working, blogging, writing, etc.
2. Do not put title numbers

### NOTE: DO NOT CHANGE previously published articles, you may broke the existing links!
